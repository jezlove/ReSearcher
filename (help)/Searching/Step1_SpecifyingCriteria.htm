        <span>The input box below the <em>Path(s) and filter:</em> heading (shown in <a href="#searchFormFigure">Figure 1</a>), is for editing the target search files and/or directories to be searched.</span>
        <span>The drop-down box to the right is for editing the filter to be used for any directories in that list.</span>

      <p>
        <span>If no Browse view tab was open then this list will be empty, but can be entered manually on this screen.</span>
        <span>It is recommended in this case, to cancel and browse for files and directories using the Browse view, see: <a href="../Browsing/Browsing.htm">Browsing</a>.</span>
