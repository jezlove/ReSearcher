      <p>
        <span>XPath (or XML Path Language) is a language for querying xml documents.</span>
        <span>ReSearcher supports EPUB, a popular document format but one which is essentially a Zip archive of XHTML documents (combined with other supporting files).</span>
        <span>XHTML is a subset of XML, this enables the use of XPath queries to select nodes (parts of) of an XHTML document to search within.</span>
        <span>The use for this feature would be if you wanted to search only in tables (<code>.//table</code>) or only within headings (<code>.//h1|.//h2|.//h3|.//h4|.//h5|.//h6</code>).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Because this is a broad and complicated topic, I will not be elaborating in any greater detail on how to use XPath expressions as it has already been better explained online.</span>
        <span>See: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp</a> for a brief introduction to XPath.</span>
        <span>And also, for more information about XHTML, see: the W3C standard <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/</a> or for a brief introduction see: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_xhtml.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_xhtml.asp</a>.</span>

            <strong>Note:</strong> when browsing external sources for information regarding XPath expressions make sure that you only use constructs that are supported by XPath version 1.0 (and the .Net Framework XPath implementation).</span>
          <span>See <a href="#dotNetXPathImplementationSection">.Net XPath implementation</a> below for more details.</span>

      <p>
        <span>XPath is a format (among many) created by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) but different vendors have created implementations of it.</span>
        <span>ReSearcher uses the XPath version 1.0 implementation provided by the .Net Framework.</span>
        <span>More information on the specifics of this implementation can be found at: <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-3.5/ms256115(v=vs.90)">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-3.5/ms256115(v=vs.90)</a>.</span>
        <span>Additionally, to find out more information about XPath version 1.0, see: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116/">https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116/</a>.</span>
        <span>Lastly, to compare XPath version 1.0 to other versions, see: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/">https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/</a>.</span>

      <p>
        <span>Another popular document format that uses XML within a Zip archive is Office Open XML, in particularly: Word (WordprocessingML).</span>
        <span>However, searching with XPath expressions within this format is not presently supported.</span>
