      <p>
        <span>EPUB (also variously styled as ePUB or ePub) is a popular document format originally developed by the IDPF (International Digital Publishing Forum), prior to their merger with the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>ReSearcher supports searching within EPUB files and even permits the use of XPath queries to narrow down searches.</span>
        <span>This is because the format is essentially a Zip archive of XHTML documents (navigable by XPath), along with some other supporting files.</span>
        <span>For more information on searching with XPath queries, see <a href="../../Expressions/XPathExpressions/XPathExpressions.htm">XPath expressions</a>.</span>

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <span>
            <strong>Note:</strong> presently, only the XHTML files within an EPUB are searchable.</span>
