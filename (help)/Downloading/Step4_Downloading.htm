        <span>Upon <a href="Step3_SelectingFilesToDownload.htm">Step 3</a> having been completed.</span>
        <span>The program will begin downloading all of the available downloads that you selected.</span>
        <span>Progress is recorded as a percentage and also displayed with a progress bar (pictured below in <a href="#downloadingFormFigure">Figure 1</a>).</span>
        <span>Additionally, the file that is currently being downloaded is displayed as part of a 'running log'.</span>

      <p>
        <span>To stop the progress of downloading: <strong>click</strong> on the <em>Stop</em> button.</span>
        <span>This will abandon the downloading procedure (your user profile will be signed-out) and you will have to start again from <a href="Step1_SigningIn.htm">Step 1</a> to download any additional files.</span>

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <span>
            <strong>Note:</strong> files that completed downloading are not deleted.</span>
          <span>This is why this operation is called stopping rather than cancelling.</span>
